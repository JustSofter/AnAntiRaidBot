# Something for Antiraids
Just a Anti-raid bot, nothing weird.

## Installation

First, you need to provide a Token for the bot to log on, you need to go to the Discord Developer Portal, and create a Application, then go to the Bot section and select "Add a Bot".

Second, copy the Token that's been provided, and put it in a file named ".env" with this format:
```
TOKEN=your-token-here
```

After this, enable the Privileged Gateway Intents, and then you need to install Node.JS in the host machine, and type in the console or terminal inside the bot folder
```
npm install
```

And all the packages will be installed correctly, then type in the console or terminal
```
node index.js
```

And, the bot will be on.

If you want to invite the bot, you can go to the OAuth2 section of your app in the Discord Developer Portal and select the Bot section, and down there will be a Link, and below will be the Permission configuration for the Invite, then copy the Invite Link and invite it to your server, then authorize yourself and that's it, you have the bot.

Remember to turn on the Bot, or it wouldn't work.
